# Two Puzzles

## Nine balls

   You have nine balls. Eight are of the same weight, and one is heavier. You are given a balance which tells you only whether the left side or the right side heavier. Find the heavy ball in just two uses of the scale.

   `hint: divide the balls into sets of three items each`

## Two ropes

   You have two ropes, and each takes exactly one hour to burn. How would you use them to time exactly 15 minutes? Note that the ropes are uneven densities, so half the rope length-wise does not necessarily take half an hour to burn.

   `hint: Light rope 1 and both ends and rope 2 at on end`
